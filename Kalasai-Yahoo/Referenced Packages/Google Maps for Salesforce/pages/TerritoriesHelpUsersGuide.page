			Views
		</div>
		
		<p>You can create Map <b>Views</b> that map these items:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Accounts</li>
			<li>Opportunities</li>
			<li>Contacts</li>
			<li>Leads</li>
			<li>Campaigns</li>
			<li>Cases</li>
			<li>Assets</li>
			<li>Contracts</li>
			<li>Custom Objects</li>
			<li>Tasks</li>
			<li>Events</li>
			<li>Users</li>
			<li>Custom Locations (favorite hotels, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>There are five kinds of views:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Single Role View:</b> Show items belonging to multiple users in a single role</li>
			<li><b>Multiple Role View:</b> Show items belonging to multiple users across multiple roles</li>
			<li><b>Campaign View:</b> Show Campaign Members (Leads, Contacts and Opportunities) for a Campaign</li>
			<li><b>Custom View:</b> Show Custom Locations that you define</li>
			<li><b>Combination View:</b> Combines two or more views</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Below the map on the main screen is a drop-down list that shows all saved map views in your organization. 
			Select a view from the list to load and map it.</p>
		
		<p>With a view selected, a detail box appears below the map showing its Definition.</p>
		
		<p>Below the map Definition is Listing of all the items that belong to the view, 
			including items that haven't been mapped.</p>
		 
		<p>Click on a map marker to pop up information about the mapped item. You can also click on an item's
			name in the Listing to locate the item on the map.</p>
		
		<p>If there are any trips saved for a view, they will appear in the Trip drop-down box below the map. 
		Open a trip by selecting it from the drop-down list.</p>

		<p>To define a view, click the <b>Create New View</b> link next to the drop-down list of views. 
		Defining views lets you control what markers appear on the map. After specifying the view parameters (users, roles, etc.), 
		you can add Custom Location markers to a view, and you can filter which items are mapped based on Field and Record Type values.</p>
		
		<p>If you have any Single Field Filters defined, you can switch map marker color schemes between user/role colors and
		filter colors.</p>
		
		<p>You can select up to five fields whose values will be displayed along with the map marker.</p>
		
		<p>You can set visibility on views based on User Groups and Roles, or make a view private or visible to everyone.</p>
		
		<p>Once a view is loaded, you can click the <b>Save View State</b> button to save the current center point,
			zoom level and terrain type for that view</p>

		<p>Click the <b>Clone</b> button to clone the current view and any associated trips.</p>
		
		<p>Views can be created from the Salesforce Account detail page by clicking the <b>Territory</b> button. 
			This will create a view with the account mapped along with all other accounts owned by the account owner. You
			can also create a view by clicking the <b>Google Map</b> button on several Salesforce List Views. Doing
			so will create a map view with the items you checked. Your System Administrator must
			enable these buttons for them to appear.</p>
		
		<p>Clicking the <b>Reset Map</b> button above the map will reset the map view to its default center point, zoom level and type.</p>
		
		<p>Clicking the <b>Outlines</b> button below the map will open the Outlines Editor for drawing polylines and polygones on a map view.
		Outlines can be saved as templates to be used in other map views.</p>
		
		<p>Clicking the <b>Add Marker</b> button below the map to add ad-hoc markers to the view.</p>
		
		<div class="sectionheader">
			Geocoding Map Objects
		</div>
	
		<p><i>Geocoding</i> refers to the process of converting an address to Latitude/Longitude coordinates.</p>
		
		<p><b>An item will not appear on the map until it is geocoded.</b></p>
		
		<p>Once geocoded, an item's geocode coordinates is saved in Salesforce. The coordinates will remain associated 
		with the item until the itemâ€™s address is changed and its coordinates cleared, and it will be necessary to geocoded 
		the item again.</p>

		<p>When a view is definded, it is possible that some of the items that should be shown for that view do not appear on 
		the map because they haven't been geocoded. The Listing section below the map will show you which items need
		geocoding. You can select these items and click the <b>Geocode</b> button to geocode them.</p>

		<p>Accounts can be manually geocoded by clicking the <b>Geocode</b> custom button for Accounts.</p>

		<p>System Administrators can do batch geocoding on the Administrator Tools page.</p>

		<div class="sectionheader">
			Trips
		</div>

		<p>Trips can be created by selecting map markers from a view as trip waypoints. Trips can be saved for later retrieval.
		When a trip is open, multi-point trip directions are displayed below the map in your local language. The directions can be for
		driving or walking, on highways or avoiding highways.</p>

		<p>With a map view loaded, you use the buttons on the map pop ups to define the trip.</p>

		<p>Click the <b>Adobe PDF</b> icon to the left of the Trip Directions to create a PDF file with the directions for
			saving and printing.</p>

		<p>Click the <b>Save As</b> button to save a copy of a trip with a different name.</p>


		<div class="sectionheader">
			Exporting Map Views and Trips
		</div>
	
		<p>Map Views and Trips can be exported to KML format which is readable by <b>Google Earth</b> and 
		Google <b>My Maps</b>. You can view your Map Views and Trips on your mobile phone if your phone
		is able to show Google <b>My Maps</b>.</p>
		
		<p>Map Views and Trips can be exported to GPX format which is readable by GPS devices.</p>

		<p>Use the search box on the lower left hand corner of the map to search within the area currently visible in the map. 
		For example, to find restaurants or hotels at a particular location, zoom in to that location and type, 
		for example, <i>restaurants</i> or <i>italian restaurants</i> or <i>panera</i> or <i>hilton hotel</i> into the search box.</p>
		
		<p>Use the Drag-Zoom button on the map to interactively zoom in on an area of the map.
